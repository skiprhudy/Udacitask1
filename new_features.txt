New features:

1) Print by status (completed == true or completed == false)
		The idea is to show what items in list are complete vs. what are not.
2) Include date info: created, updated, and how old (age)
    Usually a task app will provide a user with info on when the item
    was created, when it was finished, but also it's current (or final)
    'age' -- how long the item has been open or how long it was until
    it was completed.
3) ProgressBar (it's not a real one, just pretend for demo)
		I threw this in to illustrate some delays during the completion
		of some items in the lists.
4) Print by date (ascending or descending)
		This can be useful for showing the oldest items in list first to
		prioritize or see what's been taking the longest to complete. Or
		the shortest to complete.
